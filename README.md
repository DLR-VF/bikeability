# Bikeability

"Bikeability" is a Python package to automatically compute bike-friendliness of specific areas.
With this library users can download [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) (OSM)
 data and generate spatial indicators for bikeability (bike facilities on main streets, green share, share of secondary 
and tertiary roads, node density and bike shop density). Based on this, it is possible to calculate a bikeability index 
(Hardinghaus et al. 2021) using a weighting approach derived from an expert survey.

# Citation

If you use bikeability in your work, please cite the journal article:

Hardinghaus, Michael, et al. "More than bike lanesâ€”a multifactorial index of urban bikeability." Sustainability 13.21 (2021): 11584.


# Installation and Usage

Please see the [user guide](https://github.com/DLR-VF/bikeability/blob/master/docs/source/index.rst) 
for information about installation and usage.

# Examples

To get started with bikeability, read the user reference and see sample code and input data in
[examples repository](https://github.com/DLR-VF/bikeability-examples).

# Features

Bikeability is built on top of osmnx, geopandas, networkx.


* Download and prepare road networks and additional data from OpenStreetMap 


* Calculate indicators to derive bike-friendliness of certain regions


* Weight the indicators and generate a bikeability index

## Contributing
State if you are open to contributions and what your requirements are for accepting them.

For people who want to make changes to your project, it's helpful to have some documentation on how to get started. Perhaps there is a script that they should run or some environment variables that they need to set. Make these steps explicit. These instructions could also be useful to your future self.

You can also document commands to lint the code or run tests. These steps help to ensure high code quality and reduce the likelihood that the changes inadvertently break something. Having instructions for running tests is especially helpful if it requires external setup, such as starting a Selenium server for testing in a browser.

## Authors and acknowledgment
Show your appreciation to those who have contributed to the project.

## License

## Project status
If you have run out of energy or time for your project, put a note at the top of the README saying that development has slowed down or stopped completely. Someone may choose to fork your project or volunteer to step in as a maintainer or owner, allowing your project to keep going. You can also make an explicit request for maintainers.
